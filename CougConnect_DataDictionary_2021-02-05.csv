contact1,explanationexample,"<div class=""rich-text-field-label""><p>Social Contact Questionnaire<br /><br />[INSTRUCTIONS]<br /><br />To better understand how COVID-19 is being spread in the WSU system, we wish to understand how people meet and interact with one another. Over the course of a day, we are asking you about (1) who you interacted with, (2) where you interacted with them, (3) and for how long the interaction took place.<br /><br />We are asking you about any contact you had on a specific day over 24 hours between 11:59 pm yesterday and 11:59 pm today. This contact includes persons within your household (e.g. partner, children, roommates, etc.), as well as anyone outside your household.<br /><br />We are asking about everyone you interacted with whom you either:<br /><br />· Had a face-to-face conversation, with or without masks on.<br /><br />· Touched via skin-to-skin contact, such as a handshake, kiss, or through contact sports or other physical activity.<br /><br />· Were indoors in a room for ten or more minutes; or<br /><br />· Were non-socially distanced, indoors or outdoors, for ten or more minutes.<br /><br />Please do not provide identifying information. Rather, use a short description of that person. Your answers will be entered into a database, but all information will be encrypted and securely stored. Only researchers involved in this study will have access to the data.<br /><br />Do include everyone you interacted with, even people you very briefly spoke with (e.g., cashiers, mail/package delivery drivers, or simply in passing, such as other staff/faculty/students in hallways).<br /><br />Do NOT include people you spoke to or communicated with that you did not meet in person (e.g., zoom classes, telephone calls).<br /><br />Please use one row to record each separate person with whom you were in contact. If you have multiple contacts with the same individual in the same place during different times of the day, you can record those contacts in the same row. For example, if you have close contact and conversations with your child at home in the morning, and then again, at home in the afternoon, you can record both contact episodes in a single row. However, if you picked your child up from school and then travelled home with them on a public bus, you should record these contact episodes as two separate rows according to the context in which you met (e.g., school and travel are different contexts)<br /><br />There are six options to select when describing the context in which you interacted with an individual*:<br /><br />1. In your home<br /><br />2. At work/school<br /><br />3. Traveling (bus/car/bike/walking from one location to another)<br /><br />4. Shopping<br /><br />5. Leisure (e.g., playing sports, exercising, going to a restaurant, attending church, visiting another home)<br /><br />6. Other (any place that doesn't fit)<br /><br />*Because you may interact with the same person several times during the day, you should record all unique contexts in which you encountered that person.<br /><br />Please provide a description and approximate age of the person, location of where you met and the address, if you know it.<br /><br />Now try to estimate the maximum amount of time you spent with that individual at that location (e.g., if you spent 30 minutes in the morning at home with your significant other and then another 3 hours at home in the evening with your significant other, you would only make one entry for that individual and select more than 1 hour).<br /><br />An Example Day<br /><br />At Home:<br /><br />You start your day at home, with the rest of your family. You eat together and when you leave you kiss your partner and/or children goodbye.<br /><br />On the Way to Work:<br /><br />You briefly interact with a friend (Friend 1) in the parking lot at work: you exchange greetings and walk into work together and separate at your respective offices/workstations.<br /><br />At Work:<br /><br />At work you greet two of your regular office colleagues (Colleague 1 and Colleague 2) with whom you share an office. You all wear a mask. You spend an hour talking to each of them.<br /><br />At lunchtime, you and Colleague 2 go on a walk and stop at a café for coffee to bring back. At the café you are joined by another person from work, Colleague 3, whom you exchange greetings and stand in line with. While at the café you speak to two baristas.<br /><br />During your working day you meet with three students individually in your office - you are not 6-ft apart but keep your masks on.<br /><br />On the Way Home:<br /><br />On the way home from work, you stopped at Safeway and speak to two other customers and a cashier.<br /><br />At Home:<br /><br />After work, you return home where you spend further time with your family, eating and interacting with your partner/children before going to bed.<br /><br />EXAMPLE QUESTIONNAIRE:<br /><br /></p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width:

You can assume you interacted with your family members or those you live with as you normally do and can designate broad categories of people. For example, if you are an instructor who usually teaches a Fall Semester class with 25 undergraduates, you can fill out your course assuming full attendance. Similarly, if it is Wednesday, and normally on Wednesday you go out to dinner with colleagues after work, you can fill out a typical version of that - having a conversation with the host or hostess, spending an hour with the people who would usually attend, etc.</p></div>",text,Contact title or description of person/s,,,,,,,,y,RH,,,,
